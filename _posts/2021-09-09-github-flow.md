# Github Flow

The common github flow is described in this [document](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

- Create a branch
- Add commits
- Open a Pull Request
- Discuss and review your code
- Deploy
- Merge

Some common command is showing below:

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/felixxfeng/blogs.git
cd blogs
git checkout -b test-pr
git add . && git commit -m "test-pr"
git push origin test-pr
```
You also can use the Github Desktop. It is more user-friendly.
